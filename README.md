Your TODO task is to use the already declared ArrayList or LinkedList named shingles to store the k-shingles found in the file.
Thatâ€™s where the Node<E> class comes in. You will need to create a Node for each unique shingle and maintain a count of the number
of times each shingle appears. Your list named shingles will store those Node<String> objects. Your focus should be on utilizing
the appropriate list methods.
